# DirectoryManager

## Setup

Go to the root folder and install the dependencies executing the command `npm install` or `npm i`. *Dependencies are only needed to run the tests.*

## Running the project

The program needs a commands file to perform correctly and you can pass the file path as an argument. Execute the following command in the root folder `node src/directories.js path/to/file`.

By the way, this repo has a file `/commands.txt` that you may use, so a real command to run the program is `node src/directories.js commands.txt`(located in the root folder).

## Run the tests

Go to the root folder and excecute the command `npm test`, then wait for a few seconds and you will be able to see the result. The tests are performed by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and by default I have included the coverage.
